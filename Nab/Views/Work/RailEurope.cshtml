<p>Early contract work had me working redesigning, implementing and maintaining an existing commercial site as a new ASP.NET replacement took shape.</p>
<p>Although primarily concerned with the UI and weaving new promotions into the latter, I was also spending much time writing SQL queries for the new site.</p>
<p>The replacement site is still online at: <a href="https://www.raileurope.com/">https://www.raileurope.com/</a></p>
