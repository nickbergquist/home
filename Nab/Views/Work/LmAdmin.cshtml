<p>A classic ASP site with a MySQL backend.</p>
<p>Whilst working for London Freemasonry, the administrative body for all London area Lodges and Chapters, there was a requirement for a secure administration portal in which subscriptions and other membership details could be managed.</p>
<p>Personal responsibilites included all design work and implementation, effectively acting as a sole web-developer on this project.</p>
<p>No longer online... or at least if it is... shrouded in mystery.</p>
