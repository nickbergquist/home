<p>I have worked on various aspects of many internal corporate tools including the UI, providing the same display flexibility, useability and accessibility as built into external facing sites.</p>

<p>Working environments ranged from PHP using <a href="https://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> templating to ASP.NET MVC with Razor views. Recent work was a <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a> project for a research client API using data loaded into an elasticsearch instance.</p>
